The Guessing Game is an unusual game to guess which of two randomly generated numbers A, B is greater than the other, given just one of the numbers

GuessingGame.py
I am trying to generate two random numbers A and B and then I try to guess which one is better by generating a third random number K and seeing how it relates to the number shown (A)
It is seen to work 66% of the times (which is better than a random guess)
